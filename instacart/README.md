# Overview
Instacart is a popular grocery delivery service for bringing fresh produce from supermarkets to their customers' doors. The service allows each customer to specify an order containing a number of products. The order is then fulfilled by an Instacart representative.

Instacart has published a dataset containing over 3 million orders from 2017. The purpose of this project is to:
1. Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data
2. Develop a simple model that predicts which previously purchased products will be in a given userâ€™s next order

# Datasets
